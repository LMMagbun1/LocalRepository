This is the requestor application in the Request/Reply Enterprise Integration Patterns.
The application is build with support of Spring Jms.
It is a Maven project that you can import to your IDE of choice. I built it in Eclipse Juno.

There is an uberjar that is created when you run mvn clean install.
If you don't change the uberjar is called 'esb-requestor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'

You can start the application by running the command java -jar esb-requestor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

You should run the replier application too, to see the actions.

In brief, 100 messages are sent from the requestor and there are 100 replies back from replier.
